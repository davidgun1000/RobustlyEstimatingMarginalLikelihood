This OSF page contains Matlab code to run the Importance Sampling
Squared (IS^2) method of estimating the marginal likelihood of
cognitive models developed in:

Tran et al. Estimating the marginal likelihood for cognitive models
via importance sampling.

There are three directories corresponding to a single model from the
three LBA applications in the main text:
* MainText-Forstmann
* Appendix-Wagenmakers-Expt1
* Appendix-Wagenmakers-Expt2

We provide a README file in the directory MainText-Forstmann. This
README file provides brief information about all scripts contained in
the directory. We recommend starting with the "MainText-Forstmann"
application and consulting the README file prior to using the scripts.

We do not provide a separate README file in the directories
Appendix-Wagenmakers-Expt1 and Appendix-Wagenmakers-Expt2 as the
structure is the same as MainText-Forstmann. We provide the
additional examples to help the reader generalise the method beyond
a single model applied to a single data set.
